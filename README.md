### About me! 
I have an affinity with the languages â€‹â€‹Python, Java, PHP and R! I like working with data, as it helps to make important decisions in the day-to-day life of an institution with correctly filtered and shaped data. Not limited to that, I want to learn other languages â€‹â€‹and expand my knowledge, avoiding points of comfort!

### ðŸ‘· What I'm working on
Currently, I am working on my portfolio and exploring the area of â€‹â€‹Data Science. I am taking professional courses in the area and preparing for my MBA at FIAP (Faculdade de InformÃ¡tica e AdministraÃ§Ã£o Paulista) in DATA SCIENCE & ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE. This way, I come to prepare myself for what the market needs and study more.
